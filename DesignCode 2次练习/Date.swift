        "body": "While flat design has become universal over the past 5 years, it wasn’t so common before iOS 7. It was the shift that shaped the design landscape. But to say that it hasn’t evolved would be inaccurate. iOS design has adapted to the bigger screens. What started as the ultimate opposite of hyper realistic designs that preceded it, flat design is now much more nuanced, giving way to gradients, drop shadows and cards.",

        "caption": "How bigger screens affect your design",
        "body": "Designing for the iPad isn’t as simple as flipping a switch and just making everything bigger. A larger screen provides a real opportunity to present more content while respecting some basic rules in navigation, typography and visual hierarchy. Don’t treat the iPad as just a big iPhone. Instead, treat it more like a desktop computer with touch capabilities. In other words, your users can be more productive, see more content and perform tasks faster like typing, and drag-and-drop and multi-tasking.",
